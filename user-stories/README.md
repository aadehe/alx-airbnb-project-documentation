# Airbnb Clone User Stories

## Objective
The purpose of this document is to capture the **functional requirements** of the Airbnb Clone application in the form of **user stories**.  
User stories describe system functionality from the perspective of the end-users and stakeholders, ensuring development stays aligned with real-world needs.  

## Overview
The user stories have been derived directly from the **Use Case Diagram** and the **requirements specification**.  
They cover the interactions of the three main actors:  

- **Guest**: Searches for properties, makes bookings, completes payments, communicates with hosts, and leaves reviews.  
- **Host**: Lists and manages properties, handles bookings, communicates with guests, and receives payments.  
- **Admin**: Oversees the platform, manages users and listings, moderates content, and generates reports.  

## Scope
The user stories are grouped into the following functional areas:  

1. **User Management** – account registration, login, profile management.  
2. **Property Management** – listing creation, updates, deletions, and availability management.  
3. **Search & Booking** – property search, filtering, viewing details, booking, cancellations, and history.  
4. **Payments** – secure transactions, payment history, and host payouts.  
5. **Reviews** – submitting and viewing property feedback.  
6. **Messaging & Notifications** – communication between hosts and guests, plus system alerts.  
7. **Admin Functions** – user management, content moderation, and reporting.  

## Importance
By converting use cases into user stories, this document:  
- Provides a **clear and testable backlog** for Agile development.  
- Ensures **alignment with user needs** and system goals.  
- Helps in prioritizing features for the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** versus future enhancements.
